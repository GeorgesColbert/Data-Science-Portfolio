<blockquote>
  The desires of the heart are as crooked as corkscrews <br>
Not to be born is the best for man <br>
The second best is a formal order <br>
The dance's pattern, dance while you can. <br>
Dance, dance, for the figure is easy <br>
The tune is catching and will not stop <br>
Dance till the stars come down from the rafters <br>
Dance, dance, dance till you drop. <br>
<br>
 W.H. Auden, <i>Death's Echo</i>

<blockquote>
     As Gregor Samsa awoke one morning from uneasy dreams he found himself transformed in his bed into a gigantic insect.<br>
He was lying on his hard, as it were armor-plated, back and when he lifted his head a little he could see his dome-like brown belly divided<br>
into stiff arched segments on top of which the bed quilt could hardly keep in position and was about to slide off completely.<br>
His numerous legs, which were pitifully thin compared to the rest of his bulk, waved helplessly before his eyes.<br>

What has happened to me? he thought. It was no dream. His room, a regular human bedroom, only rather too small, lay quiet between the four familiar walls.<br>
Above the table on which a collection of cloth samples was unpacked and spread out-Samsa was a commercial<br>
traveler-hung the picture which he had recently cut out of an illustrated magazine and put into a pretty gilt frame.<br>
It showed a lady, with a fur cap on and a fur stole, sitting upright and holding out to the spectator a huge fur muff into which the whole of her forearm had vanished!<br>
Gregor's eyes turned next to the window, and the overcast sky-one could hear rain drops beating on the window gutter-made him quite melancholy.<br>
What about sleeping a little longer and forgetting all this nonsense, he thought, but it could not be done,<br>
for he was accustomed to sleep on his right side and in his present condition he could not turn himself over.<br>
However violently he forced himself towards his right side he always rolled on to his back again. <br>
He tried it at least a hundred times, shutting his eyes to keep from seeing his struggling legs, and only desisted when he began to feel in his side a faint dull ache he had never experienced before.<br>
