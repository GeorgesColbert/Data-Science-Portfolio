The files HW4Data.csv and HW4Data Test.csv contain data on two variables, X and Y. The dependent variable Y is a function of X. The goal is to  develop an understanding of cross-validation, feature selection, and shrinkage methods. 

Resampling methods used were Leave-One-Out cross-validation and K-fold cross-validation.

For Feature Selections, I used best subset selection method along with Forward/Backward stepwise selection, and I also compared these models with a model that used the Lasso Skrinkage Method.
