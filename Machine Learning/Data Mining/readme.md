Data Wrangling

the data set is a compiled record of all accidents that happened in London between 2005 and 2014.
 
 The data is mined to look for insights and answers to the following points:
 
 1 - What fraction of accidents occur in urban areas? Report the answer in decimal form.
 
 2 - There appears to be a linear trend in the number of accidents that occur each year. What is that trend? Return the slope in units of increased number of accidents per year.
 
 3 -  When is the most dangerous time to drive? Find the hour of the day that has the highest occurance of fatal accidents,
 normalized by the total number of accidents that occured in that hour.
 
 4- How many times more likely are accidents involving male car drivers to be fatal compared to accidents involving female car drivers? The answer should be the ratio of fatality rates of males to females.
 
 5- How many times more likely are you to be in an accident where you skid, jackknife, or overturn (as opposed to an accident where you don't) when it's raining or snowing compared to nice weather with no high winds?
 
 6-  Do accidents in high-speed-limit areas have more casualties? Compute the Pearson correlation coefficient between the speed limit and the ratio of the number of casualties to accidents for each speed limit.
